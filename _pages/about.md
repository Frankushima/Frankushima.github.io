Hello! My name is Frank Yao and I'm a currently a Computer Engineering Student studying at UC Santa Barbara. The purpose of this website is similar to that of a resume, but more interactive and cooler looking (at least in my opinion).

However, if you would like to see a copy of my resume (basically a shorter/condensed version of the information on this site), I've attached it below.
